# Description
This project is a user interface developed for a Stratocore company exercise. Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to demonstrate my skills in front-end development and UX/UI design. The interface allows you to manage user information, customize the homepage, and features a dark mode functionality for improved accessibility.

# Features 
- User profile management: Displays user information such as name, email and phone number.
Home page customization: Reusable section design for a flexible interface that can be tailored to the user's needs.

Dark mode: Ability to switch between light and dark modes, offering a better user experience depending on the lighting environment.
- Frequent options : Quick access to sections such as documents, commands and projects, for more efficient navigation.
Technologies used

- HTML5 & CSS3: Used for interface structure and styling.
JavaScript : Enables interface interaction and dynamics.

# Accessibility :
Accessibility is an essential aspect of this project. I have ensured that the interface is usable by as many users as possible, including those with special needs. Here are just a few of the considerations taken into account:

Dark mode: This feature improves visual comfort for users in low-light environments or for those who are sensitive to bright light.

Keyboard navigation: I've made sure that all the main functions can be accessed via keyboard navigation, allowing users to navigate easily without using a mouse.

Contrasting colors: Color choices were made with contrast in mind to ensure that text was legible, even for users with color vision impairments.

Alternative text for images: All significant visual elements of the interface are accompanied by descriptive alt attributes, to ensure that they are understandable to screen reader users.

Readable fonts: I've used readable sans-serif fonts, such as Arial and Helvetica, with appropriate font sizes, to ensure easy reading for all users.

# Future improvements
Although I've taken many aspects of accessibility into account, I'm aware that there are always ways to improve. In the future, I plan to integrate additional features, such as font and text size customization options, as well as more extensive accessibility testing to ensure full compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

# Prerequisites
- Web browser: Be sure to use a modern browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

# Design inspirations and approach
This project draws on several modern UX/UI concepts to deliver an interface that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

- Microsoft Teams inspiration: The side menu and overall layout of the software are influenced by the Microsoft Teams interface, an example of modern best practice in navigation and accessibility. The side navigation allows quick and easy access to the different sections of the site, while maintaining scrollable content for greater fluidity.

- Apple widgets: Inspiration for the detailed sections and widgets comes from Apple widgets. These offer a quick overview of different functionalities, allowing users to stay informed and responsive, with an interface that can be customized to their specific needs.

- Wireframes on Figma: I designed wireframes on Figma to visualize and structure the various interface components before moving on to the development phase. These mock-ups served as a guide throughout the coding process.


# Personal note
My skills are mainly focused on UX/UI design, with front-end experience that I'm looking to develop further. This project represented a significant challenge for me, and I used several tutorials and resources to help me code and understand modern front-end development techniques.
I was keen to take on this challenge to demonstrate my interest in this project and my commitment to continually improving my skills.
